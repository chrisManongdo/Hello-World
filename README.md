# Hello-World
Beginning to actively use GitHub since it was recommended to me by a friend and I thought that this can help me in my Computer Programming jouney. 

I'm starting my Computer Science journey this year. I am accepted as a student in Brigham Young University- Hawaii, though we do online studies now as students cannot fly to campus due to Covid-19. I came across this platform because a friend recommended it to me and I wanted to make the best out of my Computer Programming experience/ journey. I am currently residing in Davao and I'm excited to see where this road will take me.
